## X-ray Imaging

X-ray imaging represents one of the oldest and most fundamental medical imaging techniques, using high-energy electromagnetic radiation to create images of internal structures. When X-rays pass through the body, they are absorbed differently by various tissues based on their density and atomic composition, creating a projection image on a detector.

At its core, X-ray imaging works by directing a controlled beam of X-rays through the patient's body toward a detector. Dense structures like bones absorb more radiation and appear white or light gray on the resulting image, while less dense tissues like fat and air appear darker. This differential absorption creates the contrast necessary for diagnostic interpretation.

In radiation oncology, conventional X-ray imaging serves multiple critical functions. During the treatment planning phase, X-rays help localize tumors and identify anatomical landmarks. Throughout the treatment course, they verify patient positioning and treatment field alignment through portal imaging. For certain cancer types, particularly those affecting bony structures, X-rays provide valuable diagnostic information and can help monitor treatment response.

The technology has evolved significantly from traditional film-based systems to digital radiography, which offers improved image quality, lower radiation doses, and enhanced workflow efficiency. Modern X-ray systems in radiation oncology departments often feature flat-panel detectors that convert X-rays directly into digital signals, enabling immediate image review and integration with treatment planning systems.

Despite being one of the oldest imaging technologies, X-ray imaging continues to play a vital role in radiation oncology due to its accessibility, speed, and relative simplicity. When combined with newer technologies like cone-beam CT, X-ray imaging provides essential guidance for precise radiation delivery.

### Clinical Uses in Radiation Oncology

X-ray imaging serves multiple essential functions in radiation oncology practice:

- **Treatment planning support**: Provides initial anatomical information for treatment planning, particularly for bone-related targets
- **Patient positioning verification**: Ensures accurate patient setup before treatment delivery
- **Portal imaging**: Verifies radiation field placement during treatment
- **Treatment response assessment**: Monitors changes in tumor size or bone healing after radiation therapy
- **Brachytherapy guidance**: Assists in the placement of radioactive implants
- **Skeletal metastasis evaluation**: Identifies and assesses bone metastases that may require palliative radiation
- **Complication monitoring**: Detects radiation-induced changes such as radiation pneumonitis

The simplicity and accessibility of X-ray imaging make it a practical first-line imaging option for many radiation oncology applications, particularly when rapid assessment is needed or when more complex imaging modalities are unavailable.

### Strengths and Limitations

X-ray imaging offers several distinct advantages that maintain its relevance in modern radiation oncology:

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|
| Widely available and accessible | Limited soft tissue contrast |
| Relatively inexpensive | Two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional structures |
| Fast acquisition time | Uses ionizing radiation |
| Excellent for visualizing bone structures | Cannot distinguish between many types of soft tissues |
| Portable options available for bedside imaging | Higher risk for children and pregnant women |
| High spatial resolution for certain applications | Multiple exposures increase lifetime radiation risk |
| Established technology with well-understood parameters | Cannot visualize physiological or functional information |

Understanding these strengths and limitations helps radiation oncologists determine when X-ray imaging is appropriate and when more advanced modalities should be employed. For example, while X-rays excel at detecting bone metastases, they are less effective for delineating soft tissue tumors where CT or MRI would be preferred.

## Computed Tomography (CT)

Computed Tomography (CT) represents a revolutionary advancement in medical imaging that transformed radiation oncology practice. Developed in the 1960s by Godfrey Hounsfield, CT technology creates cross-sectional images by acquiring multiple X-ray projections around a patient and using computer processing to reconstruct detailed tomographic slices.

Unlike conventional X-rays that project all structures onto a single plane, CT provides true anatomical cross-sections by measuring the X-ray attenuation coefficients of tissues from multiple angles. These measurements are reconstructed into images where each pixel represents a tissue's radiodensity, quantified in Hounsfield Units (HU). This standardized scale assigns water a value of 0 HU, with air at approximately -1000 HU and dense bone reaching +1000 HU or higher.

In radiation oncology, CT serves as the primary imaging modality for treatment planning due to its excellent geometric accuracy, tissue density information, and widespread availability. The electron density information derived from CT images is essential for calculating radiation dose distributions, as it directly correlates with how radiation interacts with tissues. This makes CT indispensable for creating accurate dose calculations in treatment planning systems.

Modern CT scanners can acquire images with submillimeter resolution in seconds, enabling rapid imaging of entire anatomical regions with minimal motion artifacts. Advanced techniques like four-dimensional CT (4D-CT) capture organ motion throughout the respiratory cycle, critical for treating tumors in the chest and abdomen where respiratory movement affects target position.

The evolution of CT technology continues with dual-energy CT, which uses two different energy spectra to better characterize tissues, and cone-beam CT integrated into linear accelerators, which enables image-guided radiation therapy with daily verification of tumor position.

### Clinical Uses in Radiation Oncology

CT imaging is fundamental to radiation oncology workflow and serves multiple critical functions:

- **Treatment planning**: Provides the primary dataset for defining target volumes and organs at risk
- **Electron density mapping**: Enables accurate dose calculation algorithms
- **Tumor localization and volume determination**: Precisely defines the extent of disease
- **Image guidance during radiation therapy**: Verifies patient positioning before and during treatment
- **Response assessment**: Evaluates tumor changes during and after treatment
- **Adaptive radiotherapy**: Supports plan modifications based on anatomical changes during treatment
- **Stereotactic radiosurgery planning**: Provides high-precision targeting for focused radiation delivery
- **Virtual simulation**: Replaces conventional simulators for treatment field design

The integration of CT into radiation therapy workflows has dramatically improved treatment precision and enabled the development of highly conformal techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

### Strengths and Limitations

CT imaging offers numerous advantages that have established it as the cornerstone of radiation oncology imaging:

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|
| High spatial resolution | Radiation exposure (ionizing radiation) |
| Excellent geometric accuracy | Limited soft tissue contrast compared to MRI |
| Fast acquisition time | Risk of contrast agent reactions |
| Provides electron density information for dose calculation | Not ideal for certain soft tissue evaluations |
| Widely available | Motion artifacts can affect image quality |
| Relatively affordable compared to other advanced modalities | Limited functional information |
| Provides detailed anatomical information | Dental and other metal artifacts can degrade image quality |

Despite these limitations, CT remains the primary imaging modality for radiation therapy planning due to its geometric accuracy, electron density information, and widespread availability. When enhanced soft tissue contrast is needed, CT is often supplemented with MRI or PET imaging through image registration techniques.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents a paradigm shift in medical imaging, providing exceptional soft tissue contrast without using ionizing radiation. Developed in the 1970s based on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance, MRI has become an indispensable tool in radiation oncology for precise tumor delineation and critical structure identification.

MRI utilizes powerful magnetic fields, radio frequency pulses, and sophisticated computer processing to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures. The fundamental principle involves aligning hydrogen protons in the body with a strong magnetic field, then disturbing this alignment with radiofrequency pulses. As protons return to their equilibrium state, they emit signals that are detected and processed into images. The varying relaxation properties of different tissues—primarily T1 (longitudinal) and T2 (transverse) relaxation times—create the remarkable contrast that distinguishes MRI from other imaging modalities.

In radiation oncology, MRI excels at visualizing tumor boundaries in soft tissues, particularly in the brain, head and neck, pelvis, and liver. The superior contrast between tumor and surrounding normal tissues enables more precise target volume delineation, potentially reducing treatment volumes and sparing healthy tissue. This is especially valuable for tumors that are poorly visualized on CT, such as prostate cancer, where MRI has become the gold standard for local staging and treatment planning.

Modern MRI techniques have expanded beyond anatomical imaging to include functional and physiological assessment. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measures the random motion of water molecules, helping identify areas of restricted diffusion characteristic of many tumors. Perfusion imaging evaluates tissue vascularity, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides biochemical information about tissue metabolism. These advanced techniques offer insights into tumor biology that can inform treatment decisions and response assessment.

The integration of MRI into radiation therapy workflows continues to evolve, with MRI simulators and MRI-guided linear accelerators representing the cutting edge of technology that enables real-time imaging during treatment delivery.

### Clinical Uses in Radiation Oncology

MRI serves multiple critical functions in modern radiation oncology practice:

- **Tumor delineation**: Superior soft tissue contrast for precise target volume definition
- **Treatment planning for specific sites**: Essential for brain, head and neck, prostate, and gynecological cancers
- **Critical structure identification**: Clearly visualizes organs at risk, particularly neural structures
- **Functional imaging**: Provides information on tumor physiology through techniques like diffusion and perfusion imaging
- **Treatment response assessment**: Evaluates changes in tumor size, composition, and function during and after treatment
- **Brachytherapy guidance**: Assists in applicator placement and dose planning for prostate and gynecological brachytherapy
- **Stereotactic radiosurgery planning**: Provides detailed anatomical information for precise targeting
- **MR-guided radiotherapy**: Enables real-time imaging during treatment delivery with specialized systems

The integration of MRI with CT through image registration has become standard practice for many disease sites, combining the electron density information from CT with the superior soft tissue contrast of MRI.

### Strengths and Limitations

MRI offers several distinct advantages while also presenting certain challenges in radiation oncology applications:

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|
| Excellent soft tissue contrast | Longer acquisition time compared to CT |
| No ionizing radiation | Higher cost and limited availability in some regions |
| Multiple contrast mechanisms (T1, T2, FLAIR, etc.) | Contraindicated for patients with certain metallic implants |
| Functional and physiological information | Claustrophobia issues for some patients |
| High sensitivity for detecting certain pathologies | Motion artifacts can degrade image quality |
| Multiplanar imaging capabilities | Geometric distortion can affect treatment planning accuracy |
| Advanced techniques for tissue characterization | Not suitable for patients with certain medical devices (pacemakers, etc.) |

Despite these limitations, MRI has become essential in radiation oncology, particularly for tumors in anatomical regions where soft tissue contrast is crucial for accurate target delineation. Ongoing technological developments continue to address the challenges of geometric distortion and integration into treatment planning systems.

## Ultrasound Imaging

Ultrasound imaging represents a unique approach to medical visualization that uses high-frequency sound waves rather than ionizing radiation to create real-time images of internal structures. This non-invasive modality has carved out specific niches in radiation oncology practice, particularly for applications requiring real-time guidance and where radiation exposure is a concern.

The fundamental principle of ultrasound involves transmitting sound waves with frequencies above the range of human hearing (typically 2-15 MHz) into the body using a transducer. As these waves encounter tissues with different acoustic properties, they are reflected back to the transducer at varying intensities. The transducer converts these reflected sound waves into electrical signals that are processed to generate real-time images. The time delay between transmission and reception of the sound waves determines the depth of the reflecting structures, while the intensity of the reflected signals creates contrast between different tissue types.

In radiation oncology, ultrasound serves specialized functions rather than as a primary planning modality. Its most established role is in prostate brachytherapy, where transrectal ultrasound guides the precise placement of radioactive seeds. For external beam radiation therapy of prostate cancer, transabdominal ultrasound systems can verify daily prostate position, enabling image-guided treatment delivery without additional radiation exposure. Ultrasound has also found applications in breast cancer radiotherapy for tumor bed localization after lumpectomy and in abdominal treatments for tracking organ motion.

The technology continues to evolve with 3D/4D capabilities that capture volumetric data over time, elastography that measures tissue stiffness, and contrast-enhanced techniques that improve visualization of vascular structures. These advancements expand the potential applications of ultrasound in radiation oncology, particularly for real-time monitoring during treatment delivery.

While ultrasound cannot replace CT or MRI for comprehensive treatment planning due to its limited field of view and operator dependence, its unique advantages of real-time imaging, absence of ionizing radiation, and portability make it a valuable complementary tool in specific clinical scenarios.

### Clinical Uses in Radiation Oncology

Ultrasound serves several specialized functions in radiation oncology practice:

- **Prostate brachytherapy guidance**: Real-time visualization for radioactive seed placement
- **Image-guided radiation therapy**: Daily localization of prostate and other accessible tumors
- **Breast tumor bed localization**: Identification of the lumpectomy cavity for partial breast irradiation
- **Organ motion assessment**: Real-time monitoring of abdominal organ movement during respiration
- **Gynecological brachytherapy**: Assistance in applicator placement and assessment
- **Soft tissue visualization**: Complementary information for treatment planning in accessible sites
- **Vascular assessment**: Evaluation of tumor vascularity with Doppler and contrast-enhanced techniques

The real-time nature of ultrasound imaging provides unique capabilities for certain radiation oncology applications, particularly when immediate feedback is needed during procedures.

### Strengths and Limitations

Ultrasound imaging offers several distinct advantages while also presenting certain inherent limitations:

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|
| No ionizing radiation | Limited depth penetration |
| Real-time imaging capability | Operator-dependent (requires skilled technicians) |
| Highly portable | Limited field of view |
| Cost-effective compared to other modalities | Difficulty imaging through bone or air |
| Excellent for soft tissue differentiation in accessible regions | Image quality affected by patient factors (obesity, etc.) |
| No special preparation required for most examinations | Less detailed for certain applications compared to CT/MRI |
| Doppler capabilities for vascular assessment | Resolution limitations for deep structures |

Understanding these strengths and limitations helps radiation oncologists determine when ultrasound can provide valuable information and when other imaging modalities are more appropriate. The complementary nature of ultrasound makes it particularly useful in multimodality imaging approaches.

## Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) represents a revolutionary approach to medical imaging that visualizes physiological and biochemical processes rather than just anatomical structures. This molecular imaging technique has transformed radiation oncology by enabling visualization of tumor metabolism, proliferation, and hypoxia, providing critical information for target delineation and treatment response assessment.

PET imaging relies on the detection of positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals (tracers) that are introduced into the patient's body, typically via intravenous injection. These tracers consist of biologically active molecules labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides such as fluorine-18, carbon-11, or oxygen-15. As these radionuclides decay, they emit positrons that travel a short distance before colliding with electrons in surrounding tissues. This collision results in annihilation, producing two 511 keV gamma rays traveling in nearly opposite directions. PET scanners detect these coincident gamma rays and use sophisticated algorithms to reconstruct three-dimensional images of the tracer distribution.

The most widely used PET tracer is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a glucose analog that accumulates in metabolically active tissues, particularly malignant tumors that exhibit increased glucose metabolism. However, numerous other tracers have been developed to target specific biological processes, including 18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) for cell proliferation, 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) for hypoxia, and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) tracers for prostate cancer.

In radiation oncology, PET/CT has become an essential tool for target volume delineation in multiple cancer types, particularly lung, head and neck, lymphoma, and increasingly, prostate cancer. The metabolic information from PET complements the anatomical information from CT, allowing radiation oncologists to more accurately define tumor extent and distinguish viable tumor from atelectasis, necrosis, or fibrosis. This functional information can lead to both expansion of target volumes to include PET-positive regions not apparent on CT and reduction of volumes by excluding PET-negative regions that appear abnormal on CT.

Beyond initial staging and treatment planning, PET plays a crucial role in treatment response assessment and adaptive radiotherapy. Early metabolic changes during treatment can predict ultimate response, potentially allowing for treatment intensification in poor responders or de-escalation in good responders.

The integration of PET into radiation therapy workflows continues to evolve, with developments in respiratory-gated PET acquisition, novel tracers for specific tumor types, and the emergence of PET/MRI as a hybrid modality combining the metabolic information of PET with the superior soft tissue contrast of MRI.

### Clinical Uses in Radiation Oncology

PET imaging serves multiple critical functions in modern radiation oncology practice:

- **Tumor staging and characterization**: Identifies the extent of disease, including distant metastases
- **Target volume delineation**: Defines metabolically active tumor regions for treatment planning
- **Treatment response assessment**: Evaluates metabolic changes during and after treatment
- **Adaptive radiotherapy**: Guides plan modifications based on tumor response
- **Radiation dose escalation**: Identifies regions of high metabolic activity or hypoxia for dose painting
- **Recurrence detection**: Distinguishes between post-treatment changes and tumor recurrence
- **Prognostic information**: Provides data on tumor aggressiveness and likely treatment response
- **Treatment field verification**: Ensures coverage of all metabolically active disease

The integration of PET into radiation therapy planning has significantly impacted target definition for multiple cancer types, often changing management decisions and treatment volumes compared to conventional imaging alone.

### Strengths and Limitations

PET imaging offers several distinct advantages while also presenting certain challenges in radiation oncology applications:

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|
| Visualizes metabolic/functional information | Limited spatial resolution compared to CT/MRI |
| Highly sensitive for detecting many cancer types | Radiation exposure to patient |
| Whole-body imaging capability | Relatively high cost |
| Can detect disease before anatomical changes occur | Limited availability compared to CT |
| Provides prognostic information | Requires radioactive tracer injection |
| Quantitative measurements possible | Uptake in inflammatory and normal tissues can cause false positives |
| Excellent for cancer staging and restaging | Scanning time (typically 20-30 minutes) |

Despite these limitations, PET has become an essential component of radiation oncology practice, particularly for diseases where accurate staging and target delineation significantly impact treatment outcomes. The complementary nature of functional and anatomical imaging has led to the widespread adoption of hybrid PET/CT and, increasingly, PET/MRI systems.

## Nuclear Medicine

Nuclear medicine encompasses a broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that use radioactive materials to evaluate organ function and treat disease. While often overlapping with PET imaging, conventional nuclear medicine employs different radiotracers and detection systems, providing complementary information that can be valuable in radiation oncology practice.

The fundamental principle of nuclear medicine involves administering radioactive tracers (radiopharmaceuticals) that localize in specific organs or tissues based on their physiological or pathological characteristics. These tracers emit gamma rays that are detected by gamma cameras, which create two-dimensional planar images or, with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), three-dimensional tomographic images. Unlike PET, which detects paired gamma rays resulting from positron annihilation, conventional nuclear medicine directly detects the gamma rays emitted by radiotracers such as technetium-99m, iodine-123, or gallium-67.

In radiation oncology, nuclear medicine studies provide functional information that complements the anatomical data from CT and MRI. Bone scintigraphy, using technetium-99m-labeled phosphonates, remains a standard technique for detecting bone metastases that may require palliative radiation. Sentinel lymph node mapping with radioactive colloids guides surgical sampling and subsequent radiation field design for breast cancer and melanoma. Radioiodine whole-body scanning plays a crucial role in thyroid cancer management, identifying residual disease or recurrence that may benefit from further radioiodine therapy or external beam radiation.

Beyond diagnostic applications, nuclear medicine includes therapeutic procedures collectively known as radionuclide therapy or molecular radiotherapy. These treatments use radionuclides that emit particles (typically beta or alpha particles) to deliver radiation directly to tumor cells. Examples include radioiodine (I-131) for thyroid cancer, radium-223 for bone metastases from prostate cancer, and lutetium-177-DOTATATE for neuroendocrine tumors. These therapies often complement external beam radiation therapy in multimodality treatment approaches.

The field continues to evolve with the development of SPECT/CT hybrid systems that combine functional and anatomical information, novel radiotracers for specific tumor types, and theranostic approaches that use similar compounds for both diagnosis and therapy.

### Clinical Uses in Radiation Oncology

Nuclear medicine serves several important functions in radiation oncology practice:

- **Bone metastasis detection**: Identifies osseous spread that may require palliative radiation
- **Lymphatic mapping**: Guides radiation field design based on drainage patterns
- **Thyroid cancer management**: Detects residual or recurrent disease requiring further treatment
- **Neuroendocrine tumor localization**: Identifies primary and metastatic sites for targeted radiotherapy
- **Cardiac and lung function assessment**: Evaluates potential impact of radiation on critical organs
- **Radionuclide therapy**: Delivers targeted radiation to specific tumor types
- **Treatment response evaluation**: Assesses changes in tracer uptake following therapy
- **Physiological imaging**: Provides functional information about organs within radiation fields

The complementary nature of nuclear medicine studies makes them valuable additions to the imaging arsenal in radiation oncology, particularly for specific disease sites and clinical scenarios.

### Strengths and Limitations

Nuclear medicine imaging offers several distinct advantages while also presenting certain inherent limitations:

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|
| Provides functional and physiological information | Limited spatial resolution compared to CT/MRI |
| Whole-body imaging capability for many studies | Radiation exposure to patients and staff |
| High sensitivity for specific conditions | Longer acquisition times for some studies |
| Can detect disease before anatomical changes | Limited availability in some regions |
| Quantitative measurements possible | Requires specialized facilities and handling procedures |
| Theranostic potential (diagnosis and therapy) | Interpretation complexity requiring specialized training |
| Ability to assess specific molecular targets | Short half-life of some tracers requires on-site or nearby production |

Understanding these strengths and limitations helps radiation oncologists determine when nuclear medicine studies can provide valuable information for treatment planning and response assessment. The integration of SPECT/CT has significantly improved the utility of nuclear medicine in radiation oncology by providing anatomical context for functional findings.

## Medical Imaging Storage File Types

The efficient storage, retrieval, and exchange of medical images is a critical component of radiation oncology practice. Various file formats and storage systems have been developed to address the complex requirements of medical imaging data, with standardization efforts enabling interoperability between different systems and institutions.

Medical image file formats must accommodate not only the pixel data representing the images themselves but also extensive metadata describing acquisition parameters, patient information, and in the case of radiation oncology, treatment planning details. The complexity of these requirements has led to the development of specialized formats and systems tailored to medical applications.

The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard has emerged as the universal format for medical imaging, providing a comprehensive framework for image storage, transmission, and associated information. DICOM files encapsulate both image data and a header containing metadata in a single file, enabling the accurate interpretation and display of images across different systems. For radiation oncology, DICOM-RT extensions specifically address the unique requirements of radiation therapy, including structure sets defining target volumes and organs at risk, treatment plans describing beam arrangements and dose prescriptions, and dose distributions resulting from treatment planning calculations.

Beyond DICOM, several other formats have specific applications in research and specialized clinical settings. The Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format, an evolution of the older Analyze format, is commonly used in neuroimaging research and supports better spatial orientation information. The Medical Imaging NetCDF (MINC) format, developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute, offers flexibility for multi-dimensional data and is primarily used in research environments.

For the management and distribution of medical images, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) serve as the backbone of clinical imaging workflows. These networked systems provide storage, retrieval, and viewing capabilities for DICOM images, enabling clinicians to access studies from anywhere within a healthcare network. In radiation oncology departments, PACS integration with treatment planning systems, record and verify systems, and linear accelerators creates a comprehensive ecosystem for image-guided radiation therapy.

The evolution toward enterprise imaging strategies has led to the development of Vendor Neutral Archives (VNAs) that store images in standard formats accessible regardless of the proprietary systems that created them. These advanced systems facilitate data migration, system upgrades, and interoperability across healthcare enterprises.

As imaging technologies continue to advance, storage requirements grow exponentially, necessitating robust archiving solutions that balance accessibility, security, and cost-effectiveness. Cloud-based storage options are increasingly being adopted, offering scalability and disaster recovery capabilities while raising considerations about data security and transfer speeds.

### Common Medical Image File Formats

Various file formats serve different needs in medical imaging, each with specific characteristics and applications:

| Format | Structure | Primary Use | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| DICOM | Single file with header and image data | Clinical standard for all modalities | Comprehensive metadata, universal support | Complex structure, large file size |
| DICOM-RT | DICOM extensions for radiation therapy | Radiation oncology treatment planning | Supports specialized RT objects (structure sets, plans, dose) | Requires specialized viewers |
| Analyze | Separate header (.hdr) and image (.img) files | Legacy research format | Simple structure | Limited metadata, being phased out |
| NIfTI | Single (.nii) or dual (.hdr/.img) files | Neuroimaging research | Better spatial orientation than Analyze | Limited clinical adoption |
| MINC | NetCDF-based format | Research, especially neuroimaging | Flexible multi-dimensional support | Complex structure, limited clinical use |

DICOM remains the predominant format in clinical radiation oncology, with specialized extensions addressing the unique requirements of treatment planning and delivery.

### Storage and Management Systems

Effective management of medical images requires sophisticated systems that enable storage, retrieval, and distribution:

- **PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System)**: Networked computers for storing, retrieving, distributing, and presenting medical images
- **VNA (Vendor Neutral Archive)**: Advanced PACS that stores images in standard formats accessible regardless of proprietary systems
- **DICOM servers**: Specialized systems for handling DICOM data transmission and storage
- **Treatment planning systems**: Specialized software for radiation therapy planning that imports and manages imaging data
- **Record and verify systems**: Ensure planned treatments match delivered treatments, including image verification
- **Oncology information systems**: Comprehensive platforms integrating imaging, planning, and treatment delivery data

These systems must address several critical requirements, including long-term archiving for cancer survivorship monitoring, rapid retrieval during treatment planning and delivery, integration with treatment machines, and compliance with healthcare data security regulations.

## Recap

Medical imaging forms the foundation of modern radiation oncology practice, enabling precise target delineation, treatment planning, delivery verification, and response assessment. Each imaging modality offers unique strengths and limitations, with multimodality approaches often providing the most comprehensive information for clinical decision-making.

The evolution of imaging technologies continues to drive advances in radiation therapy, from improved target definition with functional imaging to real-time guidance during treatment delivery. Simultaneously, standardized file formats and sophisticated storage systems ensure that imaging data can be efficiently managed, shared, and integrated into the radiation oncology workflow.

As imaging and radiation therapy technologies continue to advance, their integration will become even more seamless, enabling truly personalized approaches to cancer treatment based on comprehensive anatomical, functional, and biological information. Understanding the technical aspects of medical imaging modalities and their associated file formats is therefore essential for radiation oncology professionals seeking to optimize patient care in this rapidly evolving field.
